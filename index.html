Hello, I am a third year graduate student (PhD candidate) in the math department of Kansas State University. 
My major is mirror symmetry, and my minor is Lie algebra.


<h2><b>Interest</b></h2>
<ul>
	<li>Algebraic Geometry</li>
	<li>I am interested in algebraic geometry because I like the philosophy of Grothendieck, 
who successfully bridged a variety of subjects in math with a language of sheaf and category theory.
For example, &eacutetale cohomology solved Weil conjecture and it defined &eacutetale homotopy group, that corresponds to Galois theory.
So number theory and algebraic topology might be the algebraic geometric problems, and the development of algebraic geometry
is still an ongoing problem today. </li>
	<li>I am interested in non-commutative perspective for algebraic geometry (e.g. differential graded algebra, field with one-element,
	D-module, perverse sheaves, derived algebraic geometry etc). 
	For example, they give us alternative proofs of Weil conjecture from Deligne's original proof with Weil cohomology.
	They also study Langlands program, K-theory and Picard sheaves etc.
	</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>Mirror Symmetry</li>
	<li>Mirror symmetry is a correspondence of the Frobenius manifold of A-model and B-model by Barannikov morphism, where A-model studies 
Gromov-Witten invariant, which is for quantum instaton, and B-model studies Period integral, which is for superconductivity.
We care Frobenius manifold because it is studied for quantum group and Stokes matrix etc.
One of my current interests in mirror symmetry is geometric Langlands program representing Gauge theory N=4
and its connection to SYZ conjecture and Higgs bundle through the language of derived algebraic geometry. </li>
	<li></li>
	<li>Lie Algebra</li>
	<li>I am interested in geometric Satake correspondence, which is the correspondence of 
a category of D-module of Hecke categories and a category of representation of an algebraic group, which is partially proved 
by loop group and perverse sheaves. The application of geometric Satake correspondence is geometric Langlands program 
and quantum Satake correspondecen e.g. representation of quadric and Spinor variety by quantum cohomology. </li>
	<li>Another interest in Lie Algebra is Okounkov's work, bridging statistical mechanics(e.g. random partition function), 
infinite-dimensional Lie algebra, and algebraic geometry(e.g. Calabi-Yau manifold), for A-model in mirror symmetry and crystal melting etc.
	</li>
	<li></li>
	<li></li>
	<li>Geometry & Analysis & PDE & The Other</li>
	<li>I am interested in Navier Stokes Equation,
which has a relationship with statistical mechanics, (generalized)Calabi-Yau manifold, and infinite-dimensional Dynamical system.
	<li>Model Theory for number theory, G&oumldel/Chaitin, language theory, and Stochastic diffyq.
Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) with Lie algebra(LCNN), topology(TCNN),
tropical geometry(TCNN), image recognition, some of non-math hobbies(Link is Under Construction).</li>
</ul>

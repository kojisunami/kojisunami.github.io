Hello, I am a third year graduate student (PhD candidate) in the math department of Kansas State University. 
My major is mirror symmetry, and my minor is Lie algebra. <br>
<br>
Advisor: Rina Anno <br>

Email: Find my name from the department directory. <br>

<ul>
<li>
Mirror symmetry of a bounded derived categories of coherent sheaves of a cotangent bundle of 3-dimensional flag variety.
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="interest"><b>Interest</b></h2>

<div class="title">Algebraic Geometry</div>
<ul>
	<li>I am interested in sheaf/category theory.
For example, &eacutetale cohomology solved Weil conjecture and it defined &eacutetale homotopy group, that corresponds to Galois theory.
So number theory and algebraic topology might be the algebraic geometric problems, and the development of algebraic geometry
is still an ongoing problem today. </li>
	<li>I am interested in Mori's minimal model program with toric variety and log geometry.</li>
	<li>I am interested in non-commutative perspective for algebraic geometry (e.g. differential graded algebra, field with one-element,
D-module, perverse sheaves, derived algebraic geometry etc). 
For example, they give us alternative proofs of Weil conjecture from Deligne's original proof with Weil cohomology.
They also study Langlands program, K-theory and Picard sheaves etc.
	</li>
</ul>

<div class="title">Mirror Symmetry</div>
<ul>
	<li>Mirror symmetry is a correspondence of the Frobenius manifold of A-model and B-model by Barannikov morphism, where A-model studies 
Gromov-Witten invariant, which is for quantum instaton, and B-model studies Period integral, which is for superconductivity.
We care Frobenius manifold because it is studied for quantum group and Stokes matrix etc.
One of my current interests in mirror symmetry is geometric Langlands program representing Gauge theory N=4
and its connection to SYZ conjecture and Higgs bundle through the language of derived algebraic geometry. </li>
</ul>

<div class="title">Lie Algebra</div>
<ul>
	<li>I am interested in geometric Satake correspondence, which is the correspondence of 
a category of D-module of Hecke categories and a category of representation of an algebraic group, which is partially proved 
by loop group and perverse sheaves. The application of geometric Satake correspondence is geometric Langlands program 
and quantum Satake correspondecen e.g. representation of quadric and Spinor variety by quantum cohomology. </li>
	<li>Another interest in Lie Algebra is Okounkov's work, bridging statistical mechanics(e.g. random partition function), 
infinite-dimensional Lie algebra, and algebraic geometry(e.g. Calabi-Yau manifold), for A-model in mirror symmetry and crystal melting etc.
	</li>
</ul>

<div class="title">Geometry & Analysis & PDE & The Other</div>
<ul>
	<li>I am interested in Navier Stokes Equation with the relationships with statistical mechanics, 
	(generalized)Calabi-Yau manifold, and infinite-dimensional Dynamical system.
	</li>
	<li>Model Theory for number theory, G&oumldel/Chaitin, and Stochastic diffyq.
	</li>
</ul>

<li><div class="title">A-model, B-model, and mirror symmetry (Jan 19 2023)</div>
I simply defined Frobenius manifold of A-model and B-model, and defined Barannikov morphism between them 
to realize A/B-models are the dual notions.
In A-model, we define Gromov-Witten invariant for the Kontsevich moduli space.
In B-model, we define hypercohomology of the Landau-Ginzburg model over mirror dual of CP^2, and its structure is well studied
by log scheme and toric variety, but since I only finished chapter 1,2,3, I don't know the connection between them. 
This script is for QE II major exam.  <br>

<li> <div class="title">Satake Isomorphism (Dec 3 2022)</div>
Classical Satake isomorphism claims the spherical Hecke algebra (or double coset of algebraic group with p-adic number) 
has a correspondece with a representation ring of the algebraic group, and it was first formulated to prove Kazhdan-Lustzig formula.
Geometric Satake isomorphism is its generalization, where na&iumlvely we choose t-adic number in place of p-adic number to describe geometry,
or less na&iumlvely, correspondence of category of D-module of Hecke categories and category of representation of the algebraic group. 
Hecke category signifies open disk, which is why we call it "geometric".
Geometric Satake isomorphism is used to study SYZ conjecture, homological mirror symmetry conjecture, Higgs bundle etc.
Quantum Satake isomorphism relates representation of algebraic group to quantum cohomology(e.g. cohomology of Schubert cell) to study 
representation of spinor variety and Quadratic etc.
This is for the talk in KU/KSU talk and Lie algebra(math814) final presentation. <br>

<li><div class="title">Number theory with a view toward algebraic geometry (Oct 10 2022)</div>
There is no solution of quitic polynomial by roots of unity, namely, finite nonabelian Galois extension is not solvable,
but it's solvable by infinite abelian Galois extension. Consider that any polynomial of rational coefficient has a factorization
over finite field, the polynomial can be further factorized to the p-adic field(Hensel's lemma). Note that p-adic field is 
an infinite separable abelian extension of finite field, and this connects to Galois representation, so modular form and Elliptic curve,
Shimura-Taniyama conjecture, Weil conjecture: this is the foundational problem toward defining scheme theory.
In a more modern language, Grothendieck defined &eacutetale topology in scheme theory with a henselization of Zariski topology, 
and this helped to solve Weil conjecture by Deligne. This is for the talk for Graduate Student Seminar.<br>

<li><div class="title">From Bernoulli Number, Prime Number Theorem to Riemann Hypothesis (May 2018)</div>
I started from limited knowledge of college algebra and calculus 
with some complex analysis to calculate analytic functions (e.g. Gamma function, Theta function, Riemann zeta function).
Especially I realized analysis interesting because of relationship between atomic energy level, which is discrete, 
and Riemann zeta function, which is continuous (e.g. 1+2+3+...=-1/12=&zeta;(s)|<sub>s=-1</sub>). 
I realized pure mathematics is useful, and it has a lot of unpredictable connections among inside pure math, and I thought it's cool.
This is for the talk in Foothill College Research Symposium. <br>

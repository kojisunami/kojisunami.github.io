<h2><b>Koji Sunami</b></h2>

Hello, I am a third year graduate student (PhD candidate) in the math department of Kansas State University. 
My major is mirror symmetry, and my minor is Lie algebra. <br>

<h2 id="interest"><b>Interest</b></h2>

<b>Algebraic Geometry</b>
<ul>
	<li>I am interested in sheaf/category theory.
For example, &eacutetale cohomology solved Weil conjecture and it defined &eacutetale homotopy group, that corresponds to Galois theory.
So number theory and algebraic topology might be the algebraic geometric problems, and the development of algebraic geometry
is still an ongoing problem today. </li>
	<li>I am interested in Mori's minimal model program with toric variety and log geometry.</li>
	<li>I am interested in non-commutative perspective for algebraic geometry (e.g. differential graded algebra, field with one-element,
D-module, perverse sheaves, derived algebraic geometry etc). 
For example, they give us alternative proofs of Weil conjecture from Deligne's original proof with Weil cohomology.
They also study Langlands program, K-theory and Picard sheaves etc.
	</li>
</ul>

<b>Mirror Symmetry</b>
<ul>
	<li>Mirror symmetry is a correspondence of the Frobenius manifold of A-model and B-model by Barannikov morphism, where A-model studies 
Gromov-Witten invariant, which is for quantum instaton, and B-model studies Period integral, which is for superconductivity.
We care Frobenius manifold because it is studied for quantum group and Stokes matrix etc.
One of my current interests in mirror symmetry is geometric Langlands program representing Gauge theory N=4
and its connection to SYZ conjecture and Higgs bundle through the language of derived algebraic geometry. </li>
</ul>
<b>Lie Algebra</b>
<ul>
	<li>I am interested in geometric Satake correspondence, which is the correspondence of 
a category of D-module of Hecke categories and a category of representation of an algebraic group, which is partially proved 
by loop group and perverse sheaves. The application of geometric Satake correspondence is geometric Langlands program 
and quantum Satake correspondecen e.g. representation of quadric and Spinor variety by quantum cohomology. </li>
	<li>Another interest in Lie Algebra is Okounkov's work, bridging statistical mechanics(e.g. random partition function), 
infinite-dimensional Lie algebra, and algebraic geometry(e.g. Calabi-Yau manifold), for A-model in mirror symmetry and crystal melting etc.
	</li>
</ul>
<b>Geometry & Analysis & PDE & The Other</b>
<ul>
	<li>I am interested in Navier Stokes Equation with the relationships with statistical mechanics, 
	(generalized)Calabi-Yau manifold, and infinite-dimensional Dynamical system.
	<li>Model Theory for number theory, G&oumldel/Chaitin, language theory, and Stochastic diffyq.
Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) with Lie algebra(LCNN), topology(TCNN), Gauss-Manin (GMCNN),
tropical geometry(TCNN), image recognition, some of non-math hobbies(Link is Under Construction).</li>

<li><h3><b>A-model, B-model, and mirror symmetry (Jan 19 2023)</b></h3>
I simply defined Frobenius manifold of A-model and B-model, and defined Barannikov morphism between them 
to realize A/B-models are the dual notions.
In B-model, we define hypercohomology of the Landau-Ginzburg model over mirror dual of CP^2, and its structure is well studied
by log scheme and toric variety, but since I only finished chapter 1,2,3, I don't know the connection between them. 
This script is for QE II major exam.  <br>

<h3><b>Satake Isomorphism (Dec 3 2022)</b></h3>
Classical Satake isomorphism claims the spherical Hecke algebra (or double coset of algebraic group with p-adic number) 
has a correspondece with a representation ring of the algebraic group, and it was first formulated to prove Kazhdan-Lustzig formula.
Geometric Satake isomorphism is its generalization, where na&iumlvely we choose t-adic number in place of p-adic number to describe geometry,
or less na&iumlvely, correspondence of category of D-module of Hecke categories and category of representation of the algebraic group. 
Hecke category signifies open disk, which is why we call it "geometric".
Geometric Satake isomorphism is used to study SYZ conjecture, homological mirror symmetry conjecture, Higgs bundle etc.
Quantum Satake isomorphism relates representation of algebraic group to quantum cohomology(e.g. cohomology of Schubert cell) to study 
representation of spinor variety and Quadratic etc.
This is for the talk in KU/KSU talk and Lie algebra(math814) final presentation. <br>

<h3><b>Number theory with a view toward algebraic geometry (Oct 10 2022)</b></h3>
There is no solution of quitic polynomial by roots of unity, namely, finite nonabelian Galois extension is not solvable,
but it's solvable by infinite abelian Galois extension. Consider that any polynomial of rational coefficient has a factorization
over finite field, the polynomial can be further factorized to the p-adic field(Hensel's lemma). Note that p-adic field is 
an infinite separable abelian extension of finite field, and this connects to Galois representation, so modular form and Elliptic curve,
Shimura-Taniyama conjecture, Weil conjecture: this is the foundational problem toward defining scheme theory.
In a more modern language, Grothendieck defined &eacutetale topology in scheme theory with a henselization of Zariski topology, 
and this helped to solve Weil conjecture by Deligne. This is for the talk for Graduate Student Seminar.<br>

I summarized in this picture the history of math during 1990-2020. 
If we learn history, we will see the future in the 21st century. <br><br>

<h2 id="biography"><b>Biography</b></h2>
<b>Why did I start math?</b>
<ul>
<li>
When I was in middle school, I was interested in robotics, and I thought math is important for this. 
So, I tried to self-study college algebra and calculus, and I found it interesting.
Moreover, as I had read biography of mathematicians, I felt being a mathematician is cool.
</li>
<li>
I decided to major in math since my clam school teacher recommended EGA,
but from that time, I had several failure and success. In each failure, I had switched my interests among analysis, algebra or geometry,
and eventually I became able to read EGA.
</li>
</ul>
<b>Do you like algebra, analysis, or geometry?</b>
<ul>
<li>
It's complicated. When I was freshman in undergrad, I didn't like multi-variable calculus because I thought it is not simple
(later I switched my mind when I reviewed Stokes theorem in de Rham cohomology, and manifold helps us study PDE). So instead
I studied linear algebra and abstract algebra. However, I gave up because commutative algebra is too difficult, 
and Galois theory didn't show us the solution of quintic, which made me disappointed.
Afterward, I came back to calculus, and I studied analytic function (e.g. Gamma function, Theta function, Riemann zeta function),
and I learned prime number theorem, which is cool, but my professor told me the solving Riemann hypothesis is useless,
which made me disappointed, and I came back to algebra. 
I was initially interested in modular form and Eisenstein series that can describe theta function, but as I studied with the UCSC faculties,
I found variety of mathematics are interesting, and my senior thesis was about trianguated category.
In graduate school, I came back to learn Hartshorne in the first year, but I gave up because it was difficult. 
But in the second year, I learned sheaf theory in differential topology class, 
and I learned category theory and homology in homology class, which made me finally understand Hartshorne.
But after that, I was also required to study differential geometry in mirror symmetry, because it was part of the QE II major exam.
In the future, I will study whatever I found interesting/important regardless of their area.
</li>
</ul>
<b>Is Hartshorne difficult to learn?</b>
<ul>
<li>
My short answer is yes. When I was studying Hartshorne I felt there are many preliminaries for Hartshorne which makes it difficult, 
so I studied some non-algebraic geometry subjects, which helped me understand it:
I learned homological algebra, sheaf theory(differential geometry), category theory, commutative algebra, 
and it was a huge effort before going through with Hartshorne. So, it is difficult but not because of itself.
</li><li>
If we feel Hartshorne chapter 1 is not difficult but chapter 2,
I recommend tropical geometry or toric variety because it minimally requires Hartshorne chapter 1,
and if we feel Hartshorne chapter 1 is not enough, we should proceed chapter 2 and beyond.
</li><li>
Let's say Hartshorne is a reference, and we don't have to finish everything if we like.
Please minimize our effort for the first time of study.

</ul>

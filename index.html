<div class="title">Algebraic Geometry</div>
<ul>
	<li> We study algebraic geometry not only for its theoretical beauty but for the real world applications.
	For ethos, symplectic geometry derives some physics problems which derive complex geometry, which is quite algebraic geometric
	i.e. mirror symmetry and string theory.
	Second, Lie algebra was traditionally totally different subject from algebraic geometry, but turns out to be similar. 
	Third, Non-commutative geometry is for quantum mechanics. 
	F1 scheme is a monoidal scheme that can describe toric variety and K-theory,
	and from categorical perspective, it might be derived algebraic geometry. </li>
	<li>Back in 1960s, Grothendieck's philosophy is the theoretical beauty of algebraic geometry, 
	since he expanded the classical notion of algebraic variety to scheme to solve problems 
	that classically could not e.g. &eacutetale topology for log scheme, &eacutetale homotopy group. 
	Algebraic geometry for grand unified theory of mathematics. </li>
</ul>


<div class="title">Mirror Symmetry</div>
<ul>
	<li>Mirror symmetry is a correspondence of Hodge structures of geometries. For example, semi-infinite variation of Hodge structure 
	defines Frobenius manifold for A-model and B-model resp, and they are isomorphic. Mirror symmetry origicinally arised from physics: 
	A-model studies Gromov-Witten invariant that counts quantum instanton, and B-model studies Period integral
	for superconductivity. </li>
	<li>Geometric Langlands program studies string theory.
	Geometric Satake correspondence is equivalence of representation category of algebraic group (Lie algebra) 
	and category of D-modules (algebraic geometry). It describes N=4 Yang-Mill theory and type IIB string theory correspondence,
	that can be further enhanced by derived algebraic geometry. Other cool stuffs are SYZ conjecture, Higgs bundle etc. </li>
	<li>&infin;-dimensional Lie algebra is a tool which helps bridge partition function
	and A-model in mirror symmetry, so they can describe crystal melting. Still mirror symmetry. </li>
</ul>


<div class="title">Geometry and Dynamic System</div>
<ul>
	<li> We describe canonical/geometric/stochastic quantization with Lie algebraic technique (or Hopf algebra), 
	while it's vice versa, we study classical theory from the quantum theory.
	We study classical thermodynamics from quantum mechanics i.e. Brownian motion (stochastic calculus) and entropy (ergodic theory). </li>
	<li> AdS/CFT might be unifying the theory of quantum gravity, that has a surprising correspondence to 4-dimensional 
	Navier Stokes Equation (NSE). </li>
</ul>

<li><div class="title">A-model, B-model, and mirror symmetry (Jan 19 2023)</div>
I simply defined Frobenius manifold of A-model and B-model, and defined Barannikov morphism between them 
to realize A/B-models are the dual notions.
In A-model, we define Gromov-Witten invariant for the Kontsevich moduli space.
In B-model, we define hypercohomology of the Landau-Ginzburg model over mirror dual of CP^2, and its structure is well studied
by log scheme and toric variety, but since I only finished chapter 1,2,3, I don't know the connection between them. 
This script is for QE II major exam.  <br>

<li> <div class="title">Satake Isomorphism (Dec 3 2022)</div>
Classical Satake isomorphism claims the spherical Hecke algebra (or double coset of algebraic group with p-adic number) 
has a correspondece with a representation ring of the algebraic group, and it was first formulated to prove Kazhdan-Lustzig formula.
Geometric Satake isomorphism is its generalization, where na&iumlvely we choose t-adic number in place of p-adic number to describe geometry,
or less na&iumlvely, correspondence of category of D-module of Hecke categories and category of representation of the algebraic group. 
Hecke category signifies open disk, which is why we call it "geometric".
Geometric Satake isomorphism is used to study SYZ conjecture, homological mirror symmetry conjecture, Higgs bundle etc.
Quantum Satake isomorphism relates representation of algebraic group to quantum cohomology(e.g. cohomology of Schubert cell) to study 
representation of spinor variety and Quadratic etc.
This is for the talk in KU/KSU talk and Lie algebra(math814) final presentation. <br>

There is no solution of quitic polynomial by roots of unity, namely, finite nonabelian Galois extension is not solvable,
but it's solvable by infinite abelian Galois extension. Consider that any polynomial of rational coefficient has a factorization
over finite field, the polynomial can be further factorized to the p-adic field(Hensel's lemma). Note that p-adic field is 
an infinite separable abelian extension of finite field, and this connects to Galois representation, so modular form and Elliptic curve,
Shimura-Taniyama conjecture, Weil conjecture: this is the foundational problem toward defining scheme theory.
In a more modern language, Grothendieck defined &eacutetale topology in scheme theory with a henselization of Zariski topology, 
and this helped to solve Weil conjecture by Deligne. This is for the talk for Graduate Student Seminar.<br>

<li><div class="title">From Bernoulli Number, Prime Number Theorem to Riemann Hypothesis (May 2018)</div>
I started from limited knowledge of college algebra and calculus 
with some complex analysis to calculate analytic functions (e.g. Gamma function, Theta function, Riemann zeta function).
Especially I realized analysis interesting because of relationship between atomic energy level, which is discrete, 
and Riemann zeta function, which is continuous (e.g. 1+2+3+...=-1/12=&zeta;(s)|<sub>s=-1</sub>). 
I realized pure mathematics is useful, and it has a lot of unpredictable connections among inside pure math, and I thought it's cool.
This is for the talk in Foothill College Research Symposium. <br>

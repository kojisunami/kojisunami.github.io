<li> <div class="title">Intro to Math Physics(Fall 2025)</div>
The goal is to discuss QFT and string theory from mathematical perspective e.g. S/T-duality and Weinberg-Salam theories etc, which derive Mirror symmetry,
but I'll not go depth into technical part of them.

<li> <div class="title">Intro to Deformation Theory(Spring 2025)</div>
Deformation theory studies integrable system 
(my personal perspective is non-Chaotic dynamics system using algebraic geometry and homological algebra,
assuming application is mirror symmetry).
Also, deformation theory is a broad subject, so it needs to be roughly classified,
e.g. algebraic side is &infin;-algebra, and geometrically Kodaira-Spencer, and there also might be analytic version.
Algebraically, we'll reconsider the meaning of associative algebra and its generalization e.g. what is operad?, what is configuration space?,,
and philosophical/constructive approarch of why manifold has geometric properties,
so I think deformation theory is a nice research subject to philosophically interpret what math is.
I'll also mention quantum group, and I'll also mention quantization and BV formalism.<br>
Deformation of category is pseudo-categorical e.g. from dg-category to A-&infin; category, for systematically studying elliptic complex.<br>

<li> <div class="title">From Complex Analysis to Moduli Problem(Summer 2025)</div>
The inverse problem of ordinary complex analysis is to identify and classify holomorphic functions defined on that domain,
and we'll introduce how this connects to moduli problem and what kind of complex analysis problem derives it. <br>

<li> <div class="title">Categorical Foundation and Application of Algebraic Geometry(Spring 2025)</div>
Top/X and Top/Y are equivalent, if a topological spaces X and Y are homotopic.<br>

</li>


<li> <div class="title">Foundation of Math and Essay-like Algebraic Geometry(Spring 2025)</div> 
First of all, we'll discuss set theory from research perspective for algebraic geometry.
Consider intersection/union in set theory develops intersection theory, if Euclidean topology is added.
A simplicial set is a set theoretical argument.
Hom set is a fine moduli space by categorical mean, or we may apply set theoretical quotient on it,
and its opposition notion is representation, that is to find an object X to construct a functor Hom(X,-).
Local isomorphism is paraphrase of etaleness, and surjective map is covering map or projection. 
Topologically, compactification is a criteria of integrability in real analysis, and also Poincare duality. <br>
Second is etymological perspective. 
Why do we discuss algebraic geometry, even though algebra and geometry are independent subjects.<br>
Lastly, category is exactly geometry itself, since fiber bundle consists of fiber(morphisms) and its base(objects).
Assuming we've known sheaf theory, we'll construct stack,
and how it will affect to moduli problem. <br>
Also, in foundation of math, the purpose of the expansion of naive set theory is to discuss a set of sets. 
Set of sets is actually very common in abstract/sigma algebra and category theory, hence AOC, filters, and Grothendieck universe have many applications.

<li> <div class="title">Intro to Algebra, Geometry, not Algebraic Geometry(Spring 2025)</div>
Trace of a matrix is an invariant of Haar integral, partition function of QFT, Lagrangian,
and that's representation theory (eigenvalue problem).
Another linear algebra is tensor, Z-graded vector spaces, Boson/Fermion, classifying components by dimensions and degrees,
For Lie groups, SO(3), Lorenzian, and spinors solves Schr&ouml;dinger eq, QFT, AdS/CFT, and BPS state, that's also mathematicians' interests:
These Lie groups are all rooted in su(2), and su(2) is easier because of complex number, and Heisenberg group for Symplectic geometry.
In geometry, curvature is a gap of parallel transport defined by connection, 
and curvature enumerate holonomy, that's for Chern-Simon theory in QFT.
Geometry also studies dimension and degree by intersection theory, 
and these invariants are better preserved in complex instead of real, Symplectic instead of Lagrangian resp,
that's in particular, quantum cohomology and Floer homology.
Finally, Hall algebra, Yang-Baxter, quiver, and supersymmetry, that's algebra other than homological algebra or algebraic geometry. <br>

<li> <div class="title">Intro to Homology and Category(Spring 2025)</div>
Homological algebra counts Euler characteristic and intersection theory (linearize and making it a finger counting problem),
so it's a tool that counts geometry.
Also, if the geometry has a complex structure, it might have Hodge structure,
and if we treat Lie group/algebra valued function in symplectic geometry in physics, 
it might be BRST complex to calculate ghost field/Lagrangian in QFT.
We will also explain vector bundle, that is geometric version of homological algebra, 
and the connection of vector bundle is a generalization of differential. <br>

We'll show why category theory is more powerful than abstract algebra.
From the basic categorical definition constructs standard resolution.
Presheaf is already an interesting definition, since functoriality better classifies functions than naive set theory
(if a function has singular points, the domain will dynamically change),
while contravariantness implies algebra(algebra) and coalgebra(geometry) duality. 
Sheaf theory systematically studies vector bundle, and category of coherent sheaves is abelian.
The power of category theory generalizes sheaf to stack and moduli theory.
In homological algebra, category of chain complexes is abelian, 
or derived category has triangulated and dg-structure, and rich in its structures. 
Finally, the purpose of homological algebra is to identify equivalence of categories, that's Morita equivalence and quasi-Frobenius. <br>

<li> <div class="title">Intro to Coalgebra(Nov 2024)</div>
Coalgebra is used for deformation theory. for example, dgla. Also, for example, Yang-Baxter equation, that's non commuative case.
</li>


<li> <div class="title">Unorganized A-infty structure(Fall 2023)</div>
I define dg-manifold and its correspondence to a (non-unital) A-infty structure. A-infty structure has a several computational approaches.
For example, A-infty module has a Hochschild structure.
By using this, we can define Calabi-Yau structure. Also, operadic structure is a polynomial functor that can describe A-infty structure
in a graph theoretical way, and one of the applications are Deligne conjecture on Hochschild cohomology. <br>

<li><div class="title">A-model, B-model, and mirror symmetry (Jan 19 2023)</div>
I simply defined Frobenius manifold of A-model and B-model, and defined Barannikov morphism between them 
to realize A/B-models are the dual notions.
In A-model, we define Gromov-Witten invariant for the Kontsevich moduli space.
In B-model, we define hypercohomology of the Landau-Ginzburg model over mirror dual of CP^2, and its structure is well studied
by log scheme and toric variety, but since I only finished chapter 1,2,3, I don't know the connection between them. 
This script is for QE II major exam.  <br>

<li> <div class="title">Satake Isomorphism and Geometric Langlands(Dec 3 2022)</div>
Classical Satake isomorphism claims the spherical Hecke algebra (or double coset of algebraic group with p-adic number) 
has a correspondece with a representation ring of the algebraic group, and it was first formulated to prove Kazhdan-Lustzig formula.
Geometric Satake isomorphism is its generalization, where na&iumlvely we choose t-adic number in place of p-adic number to describe geometry,
or less na&iumlvely, correspondence of category of D-module of Hecke categories and category of representation of the algebraic group. 
Hecke category signifies open disk, which is why we call it "geometric".
Geometric Satake isomorphism is used to study SYZ conjecture, homological mirror symmetry conjecture, Higgs bundle etc.
Quantum Satake isomorphism relates representation of algebraic group to quantum cohomology(e.g. cohomology of Schubert cell) to study 
representation of spinor variety and Quadratic etc.
This is for the talk in KU/KSU talk and Lie algebra(math814) final presentation. <br>

<li><div class="title">Henselization and Etale cohomology (Oct 10 2022)</div>
There is no solution of quitic polynomial by roots of unity, namely, finite nonabelian Galois extension is not solvable,
but it's solvable by infinite abelian Galois extension. Consider that any polynomial of rational coefficient has a factorization
over finite field, the polynomial can be further factorized to the p-adic field(Hensel's lemma). Note that p-adic field is 
an infinite separable abelian extension of finite field, and this connects to Galois representation, so modular form and Elliptic curve,
Shimura-Taniyama conjecture, Weil conjecture: this is the foundational problem toward defining scheme theory.
In a more modern language, Grothendieck defined &eacutetale topology in scheme theory with a henselization of Zariski topology, 
and this helped to solve Weil conjecture by Deligne. This is for the talk for Graduate Student Seminar.<br>

<li><div class="title">From Bernoulli Number, Prime Number Theorem to Riemann Hypothesis (May 2018)</div>
I started from limited knowledge of college algebra and calculus 
with some complex analysis to calculate analytic functions (e.g. Gamma function, Theta function, Riemann zeta function).
Especially I realized analysis interesting because of relationship between atomic energy level, which is discrete, 
and Riemann zeta function, which is continuous (e.g. 1+2+3+...=-1/12=&zeta;(s)|<sub>s=-1</sub>). 
I realized pure mathematics is useful, and it has a lot of unpredictable connections among inside pure math, and I thought it's cool.
This is for the talk in Foothill College Research Symposium. <br>
